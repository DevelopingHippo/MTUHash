Currently, a bug in the XOR portion of the code, but 32 bit blocks work perfectly


To Compile on a Linux Machine:

Prerequisites:
apt-get install make gcc

From the Sources Directory:
make

Put the 32x bit input into the Hashin.txt file before running the program.
To Run Program after compiling (Make sure 32x sized hash is in Hashin.txt):
./MTUHash
